### Hi there from .:serbia:

For several years I've been working in a transport and traffic engineering sector,<br/> 
but I'm returning to my old love, the one I feel best with, and that's programming.<br/><br/>
I'm working intensively on FrontEnd and BackEnd skills, and my goal is to be a full-stack web developer. 
<br/><br/>
I'm currently working on RESTful API, JPA and Java Security. :mechanic:
<br/><br/><br/>
